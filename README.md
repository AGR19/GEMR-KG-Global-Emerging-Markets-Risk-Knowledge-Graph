# SER-531-Group-1-Project-Fall-2025
The Goal of the project is to construct a knowledge graph and publish a research paper out of it.

# Datasets

1. World Bank : Global Economic Monitor
```
https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/search/dataset/0037798/Global-Economic-Monitor
```
2. World Bank : Global Emerging Markets Risk Database
```
https://data360.worldbank.org/en/dataset/IFC_GEM
```

# Goal

The World Bank provides the Global Economic Monitor (GEM) dataset. Existing visualizations for the GEM dataset can be found at the following link: [https://databank.worldbank.org/source/global-economic-monitor-(gem)](https://databank.worldbank.org/source/global-economic-monitor-(gem)).

Similarly, another dataset exists called the Global Emerging Markets (GEMs) Risk Database. However, visualizations for this emerging market risk dataset are not currently available.

Our tool is designed to combine both datasets, facilitate visualization, and answer analytical questions.

### Practical Value

The shared dimensions of **country** and **year** within these datasets enable users to:

* Link the datasets for correlation analysis (e.g., "Does inflation correlate with default rates?").
* Build predictive models using macroeconomic indicators to forecast credit risk.
* Conduct country-specific studies over the 29-year overlapping period.
* Perform regional analyses comparing economic conditions with credit risk patterns.

The primary value of this tool lies in its ability to combine these different data types using "country" and "year" as the joining keys.
